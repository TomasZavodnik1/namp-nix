parameter to 'true' under [scrobble] section,
and set 'user' to your username and 'pass'
to your plaintext password. Alternatively
you may enter the md5 of your password under
\&'md5pass'. However, if 'pass' is set, then
\&'md5pass' will be automatically set and
\&'pass' cleared the next time namp is started.
